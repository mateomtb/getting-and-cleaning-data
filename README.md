#Summary

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The code in this repository creates a tidy data set named `tidy.txt` generated from data from the Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

#Running the script
The `tidy.txt` file generated is transformed from the original data and contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject colletcted in the study. To create the tidy data set source and run the file `run_analysis.R` from your working R diretory. The directory `UCI HAR Dataset` and it's unaltered contents must be relative to the `run_analysis.R` file.

#Code Book
A description of the tidy data, it's variables and the transformations performed to create it can be found in the `codebook.md` file.
